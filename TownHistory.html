<h2><b>Wolf statues</b></h2>

The statue of "Lupoaicei din Timisoara" is a statue depicting the
 legendary prisoners of Rome, the Romulus and Remus brothers, 
breast-fed by a she-wolf. The statue renders a legend of Rome,
 according to which the two brothers who founded the city were
 cared for by a she-wolf. 
 <br><br>
 Location: The monument, located in Victoriei Square,
 is a gift made to Timisoara by the municipality of Rome,
 as a symbol of latinity that unites the Romanian and 
 Italian peoples. It is located in the city center, 
 in the market between the Opera and the Metropolitan Cathedral.
 <br><br>
 History: The inauguration of the monument took place on 23 April 1926 
 in the presence of 10,000 people. The event was attended by Dr. 
 Samuil Şagovici, the Mayor of Timişoara Vasile Goldiş, Minister 
 of Religious Affairs Grigore Trancu-Iaşi, Minister of Labor and 
 Delegates of Mussolini, the head of the Italian state at that time.
 The solemnity came with total exclusion from any role of former Mayor
 of Timisoara, Dr. Lucian Georgevici, forced to resign on April 17, in a tense climate.

Following the Vienna dictate by which Hungary received Northern Transylvania,
 the center of Timisoara was the site of a protest demonstration. Italy 
 supported the claims of Hungary, being under the leadership of Benito Mussolini,
 the statue drawing the dissatisfaction of protesters who protested against it,
 being quickly removed from the center of Timisoara.

<h2><b>Middle Ages</b></h2>
          <p>
  
  Timișoara was first mentioned as a place in either 1212 or 1266 as Castrum Temesiense. The territory later to be known
  as Banat was conquered and annexed by the Kingdom of Hungary in 1030. Timișoara grew considerably during the reign of 
  Charles I, who, upon his visit here in 1307, ordered the construction of a royal palace. Timișoara's importance also
  grew due to its strategic location, which facilitated control over the Banat plain. By the middle of the 14th century, 
  Timișoara was at the forefront of Western Christendom's battle against the Muslim Ottoman Turks. French and Hungarian 
  crusaders met at the city before engaging in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. Beginning in 1443, John Hunyadi used 
  Timișoara as a military stronghold against the Turks, having built a powerful fortress. The city was repeatedly besieged
  by the Ottomans in 1462, 1476, 1491, and 1522.

  <img alt="" src="img/Tm1.png" width="350" class="img" />
   
   In 1552, a 16,000-strong Ottoman army led by Kara Ahmed Pasha conquered the city and transformed 
   it into a capital city in the region (Temeşvar Eyalet). The local military 
   commander, István Losonczy, and other Christians were massacred on 27 July 1552 while 
   escaping the city through the Azapilor Gate.Timișoara remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 
   160 years, controlled directly by the Sultan and enjoying a special status, similar to other
   cities in the region such as Budapest and Belgrade. During this period, Timișoara was home
   to a large Islamic community and produced famous historical figures such as Osman Aga of 
   Temesvar, until Prince Eugene of Savoy conquered it in 1716. Subsequently, the city came 
   under Habsburg rule, and it remained so until the early 20th century, except for the Ottoman 
   occupation between 1788–1789 during the Ottoman-Habsburg war. The city was defortified 
   starting in 1892 up until 1910, and several major road arteries were built to connect 
   the suburbs with the city centre, paving the way for further expansion of the city.[citation needed]

It was the first mainland European city and second in the world after New York to be lit by
 electric street lamps in 1884. It was also the second European and the first city 
 in what is now Romania with horse-drawn trams in 1869. It is said that Gustave Eiffel, 
 the creator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, drew the projects of one of Timișoara's footbridges
 over the Bega, the "Metal Bridge", however, it was actually planned by Róbert Tóth, the head 
 of the Bridge Department, at the Reșița rail factory.

  On 31 October 1918, local military and political elites establish the "Banat National Council",
  together with representatives of the region's main ethnic groups: Romanians, Germans, Serbs and
  Hungarians. On 1 November they proclaimed in Timișoara the short-lived Banat Republic. In the 
  aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the Kingdom of Romania and the
  Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Timișoara came under Romanian administration after
  Serbian occupation between 1918–1919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the Treaty 
  of Trianon on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King Ferdinand I awarded Timișoara the status of a
  University Centre, and the interwar years saw continuous economic and cultural development.
  A number of anti-fascist and anti-revisionist demonstrations also took place during this time.

  
During World War II, Timișoara suffered damage from both Allied and Axis bombing raids,
 especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then 
 was a member of the Axis, declared war on Nazi Germany and joined the Allies. Surprised, 
 the local Wehrmacht garrison surrendered without a fight,[citation needed] and German 
 and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, without success.

After the war, the People's Republic of Romania was proclaimed, and Timișoara underwent
 Sovietization and later, systematisation. The city's population tripled between 1948 
 and 1992. In December 1989, Timișoara witnessed a series of mass street protests in
 what was to become the Romanian Revolution.[citation needed] On 20 December, three 
 days after bloodshed began there, Timișoara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.

  <h2><b>The Street Light</b></h2>
  
  <img alt="" src="img/Tm3.png" width="350" class="img" /></a>
  
  In front of the Banat Museum (on the side facing Lucian Blaga St.) 
  there is a street light inscribed in four languages which reminds 
  that Timişoara was the first city in Europe with streets electrically
  illuminated – more specifically, we mean that Timişoara was the first
  city where public street lighting was designed and implemented in a general system for the entire city.

In 1882, the 25 years of contract with the Viennese company that provided 
gas for lighting the streets of Timişoara ended. The provider however
 decided to increase gas prices at a level deemed unacceptable by the
 municipality. The situation was especially complicated since the pipes 
 through which the gas flowed were all owned by the provider 
 (under the contract signed 25 years prior), and the Viennese
 were determined to dismantle them quickly if the contract could 
 not be extended. Thus, there was the possibility that the city’s streets remain in the dark.

The solution came with the offer made by “Anglo Austrian Brush Electrical 
Company Limited”, a British-Austrian firm based also in Vienna; the 
building of a power plant to supply a total of 516 street lights was
 proposed (soon they would become 730 street lights). The English
 already had the know-how required for this undertaking. In England 
 the first use of electricity for street lighting had already been
 done in 1879. But in all these first cases, they were rather actions 
 of some futuristic experiments, and not long-term systems. An American 
 city reported that the main square had become “lighted as the day” ... with four street lights.

Timişoara’s case is thus clear: a revolutionary system seen not 
as an experiment, but thought that a system with hundreds of
 street lights that illuminate the city’s entire central area.
 To this also contributed the opening to the latest technical 
 novelties, typical in nineteenth century Timişoara (still existing today),
 but also the good financial situation of those years, generates mainly by 
 the accumulation of private capital in the city.
